# Handoff

This is the authoritative resume point. Permanent constraints live in `AGENTS.md` and `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. Verify actual Git refs before each task; SHAs recorded here are evidence anchors, not permanent pins.

## Verified current state – 2026-10-24

- Patch108 source `657178cb953df54d34fb794555af2b03594bb635` is the baseline for this isolated Patch109 review. Operator-supplied runtime evidence reports boot sequence 9, repeated `ESP_ERR_HTTP_CONNECT` inventory failures after about 8 hours, a full journal (16,384 records), and 142 volatile queue drops.
- The exact Patch108 source caps each `BOOT_AUTO` worker job at three transient attempts and releases its network reservation before the no-snapshot scheduler cooldown. Journal attempt numbers 952–973 are not explained by one worker loop; event interpretation or installed-source identity remains unresolved. No Homey transport root cause is established.
- Exact IDF/BSP review confirms that the diagnostic journal can write flash after RGB starts; flash writes suspend cache activity while the RGB bounce-buffer path reads PSRAM. This is a concurrency hazard, not proof that it caused the reported display artifacts.
- Active work is the isolated Patch109 offline review of retry handoff, HTTP client lifecycle after transport failure, and journal flash safety around RGB startup. Preserve journal data; do not erase it. Production awning flags remain 0/0, awning_1 disabled, Patch104's 0.53 target preserved, and PCLK remains 12 MHz. The original checkout remains intentionally older at `176e1a634eba060bd53427f2d12791db61fbc53e` with four preserved dirty paths.

## Historical Patch107 state – 2026-10-23 (superseded)


- Patch106 (`760fa99e65949ec0b2497907523220a244dc862c`) is the verified Patch107 base. Patch107 source `54ae37b11ac6888952d70bc7353d4eb841e6f219` was app-only flashed successfully: operator authorization was current, the ESP32-S3 probe passed, esptool exited 0, reported `Hash of data verified`, and performed its normal RTS reset.
- The operator reports that Homey connected after the third manual restart, the dashboard stayed visible once shown, the logo and Swedish glyphs render correctly, and no automatic ESP32 restarts were evidenced. Homey connection remains intermittent and unresolved. No Homey write or awning movement was performed. This runtime report does not establish a transport root cause or long-term reliability.
- Patch107's offline status-sequence validation and ESP-IDF v6.0.1 ARMED_TEST_ONLY build passed. The visible Wi-Fi-connected and verified Homey-READY milestones each have a 2000 ms minimum; backend work is not delayed and errors/connection loss take priority. The separate follow-up work is limited to the status-recovery regression described by the active task.
- The Patch107 test build used temporary build-only awning_2/3 write-arm overrides 1/1. Production defaults remain 0/0; awning_1 remains disabled. Patch104's 0.53 middle command target and legacy 0.50 readback remain preserved.
- Patch104's middle command target 0.53, legacy 0.50 readback, 12 MHz PCLK and existing RGB/LVGL configuration remain preserved.
- The brief image artifact at the dashboard transition remains INCONCLUSIVE; Patch107 does not claim to fix it. The reported physical observations above are limited to what the operator saw and do not establish broader runtime behavior.
- Verify actual Git refs before future work. Preserve the original checkout and all existing worktrees.

## Historical authorized work: Patch107 post-flash status recovery fix (superseded)

Reproduce the error-arrives-before-Wi-Fi-connected rendering sequence in a deterministic host regression test, then fix only the proven status-state bug in the isolated Patch107 worktree. Keep Homey/Wi-Fi transport, display configuration, 12 MHz PCLK, UI assets, awning control and production write-arm defaults unchanged. Run the focused status tests and one clean ESP-IDF v6.0.1 ESP32-S3 ARMED_TEST_ONLY build from a local commit with build-only awning_2/3 overrides 1/1. Package the release and stop without push, PR, merge, flash, serial/device operation, Homey operation or awning movement. The intermittent Homey connection and dashboard-transition image artifact remain separate unresolved observations.

## Evidence boundary and stop condition

The Patch107 flash and startup observations are physical/operator evidence only; offline tests/builds do not prove further runtime behavior. Do not infer Homey transport causality from the intermittent connection report. The dashboard-transition image artifact remains INCONCLUSIVE and is outside the active fix.
